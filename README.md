# Medli
Medli is a free and open source successor to the original Medli Classic operating system.
Re-written from the ground up, Medli picks up where Medli Classic left off, with all of the heavy foundation work done in-house.

Medli is written using C#& X# and uses the C# Open Source Managed Operating System kit and the IL2CPU compiler
