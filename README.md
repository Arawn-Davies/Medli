# Bourne-Again Medli
Bourne-again Medli is a free and open source successor to the original Medli operating system.
Re-written from the ground up, Bourne-Again Medli picks up where Medli left off, with all of the heavy work done in-house.

Medli is written using C#& X# and uses the C# Open Source Managed Operating System kit and the IL2CPU compiler
