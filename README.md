# Medli  
Medli is a free and open source operating system written by Arawn Davies and Siaranite Solutions.  
A project started in 2012, it has undergone several re-evolutions to be in its current excellent form.  
It does not aim for elegance like most desktop operating systems, but instead aims to provide a custom-tailored framework  
of several customizable daemons that can operate different servers like HTTP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, Serial and more 
   
Medli is written using C#& X# and uses the C# Open Source Managed Operating System (Cosmos) kit for upstream compiler

# Announcements
As of 07/09/2023, the AIC Framework has now been merged with this codebase, as they shared a significant amount
of common code and it was no longer viable to continue maintaining the two simultaneously.
