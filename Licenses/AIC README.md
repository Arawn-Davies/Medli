# AIC Framework
The **A**pollo **I**nter-project **C**omponent **Framework** for Cosmos C# operating systems, based on Dewitcher and Dewitcher 2 framework.  
This framework allows a base of common tools to be used within the operating systems, allowing for easier manageability and changing of components in the future when needed.

I suggest cloning this repository as a submodule in your Operating System project and you currently do need to add the three main projects as Project References
AIC.Main, AIC.Hardware, AIC.Core
